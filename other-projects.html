                <code>libnvdialog</code> is a small building block of other projects I am <br>
                currently writing, which may take months to finish. A few of the other projects I have made include:
                <br>
                <br>
                <a class="ref" href="https://github.com/AndroGR/Bluebox2D/">-> Bluebox2D, a world simulation game and the first serious project of mine. (Abandoned)</a><br>
                <a class="ref" href="https://github.com/AndroGR/CleanerApp/">-> Cleaner, a GNU/Linux cleaner application written using Gtk4 and libadwaita. (WIP)</a><br>
                <a class="ref" href="https://gitlab.com/AndroGR1/libice">-> libice, a graphics library written in C wrapping OpenGL. (Abandoned)</a>

                Along with the projects above, I sometimes develop a few other projects when I have <br>
                alot of free time. You won't see actual source code since it's still a hell of a mess. However <br>
                here are the said projects: <br>
        </p><br>

        <p class="text">
                -> Rustland, a sand simulation game written in Rust, with plugin support, great performance and low overhead. Will take alot of time. <br>
                -> Glacier Engine, hardware accelerated pixel processing library, intended for vector editors and games. Probably will be ready in a few weeks <br>
                although I don't plan to rush it. <br>

                <p class="weak">
                        Before v0.3.0 was released creating a dialog was pretty straightforward yet <br>
                        the dialog couldn't be customized at all. On top of that, those dialogs were <br>
                        created instantly, leading to tiny freezes on older hardware. This changed by <br>
                        the release of v0.3.0, and was replaced with an object-like model. Each dialog <br>
                        features a constructor, a destructor and class members, manipulated through pointers. <br>
                        <br>
                        This was largely inspired by <a href="https://gtk.org">Gtk</a>'s syntax, although with <br>
                        a bit of personal modifications to better match NvDialog. <br>
                        <br>
                        Let's see a bit better, what does this mean? Read the code below:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
#include &lt;nvdialog/nvdialog.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        NvdDialogBox* // This is an opaque type for the object.
        dialog_box = nvd_dialog_box_new(); // Constructor of the latter.

        nvd_show_dialog(dialog_box); // This is irrelevant for this case, it's just used to show the dialog.

        nvd_free_object(dialog_box); // This is the destructor.
}
                </code></pre>
                <p class="weak" align="justify">
                        As you can see, a dialog is nothing more than a simple opaque struct, which <br>
                        holds data to show a dialog box. Which makes it very easy to customize the  <br>
                        dialog before showing it, reusing it and improving performance. <br><br>
                        After the rather lengthy explanation of how NvDialog works, its time to look into <br>
                        how to actually use it: <br>
                </p>
                <p class="small">
                        First, we have to include the header, which declares and exports everything <br>
                        related to NvDialog:
                </p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;nvdialog/nvdialog.h&gt;

</code></pre>
                <p class="small">
                        Afterwards, we need to declare our <code>main</code> function. It is required to have <br>
                        the <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> parameters also included, in order to use <br>
                        <code>nvd_init</code>:
                </p>
<pre><code>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {

}
</code></pre>
                <p class="small">
                        From there on, we have to construct a new dialog object using an initializer. <br>
                        Since we are creating just a window with some text in it, we can simply use <br>
                        a single <code>NvdDialogBox</code>:
                </p>
<pre><code>
NvdDialogBox* dialog = nvd_dialog_box_new("Your title", "The message to write", NVD_DIALOG_SIMPLE);
</code></pre>
                <p class="small">
                        This is all we have to do to create a single dialog. However, constructing <br>
                        the dialog and actually rendering it to the system are seperate tasks. <br>
                        Each dialog type (<code>NvdDialogBox</code>, <code>NvdAboutDialog</code>) has <br>
                        its own function to do that, but for this case, we can simply use <br>
                        <code>nvd_show_dialog</code>:
                </p>
<pre><code>
nvd_show_dialog(dialog);
return 0; // Just to indicate success

</code></pre>
                <p class="small">
                        After all of this, we should be able to see a dialog box:
